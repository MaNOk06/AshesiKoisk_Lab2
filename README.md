# Lab_02_Ashesi_Health_Kiosk_04442028
Ashesi University’s Health Center is piloting a tiny “self-service intake kiosk.” Students walk
up, enter a few details, and the kiosk prints a short intake slip: which desk to visit, a quick
metric (e.g., BMI), a basic ID sanity check, and a short “secure” identifier.
